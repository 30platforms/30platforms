# 30 Platforms

[https://www.30platforms.com](https://www.30platforms.com) is a blog about building things on the internet. I write about different hosting platforms like Firebase and Netlify, languages like Javascript and Go and other tools available to help you get things done.

30 Platforms is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the Golang powered static site generator and uses the [Academic Theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/). 30 Platforms is hosted on Netlify and commits to the Master branch are automatically deployed.
