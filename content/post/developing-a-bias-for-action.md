If you would rather do things than simply stargazing and avoiding actual work, then you probably have an intrinsic _bias for action_. You should count yourself lucky. You like to create things rather than just dream about them. You like to get things done. You are successfully overcoming resistance.

Having a bias for action means that given two alternatives, an action vs a non-action, we tend to choose the action. We are not overly concerned about the risks or the wasted effort because we know that an action will result in new knowledge at a minimum. We would rather act upon an idea and learn from a failure, than never acting in the first place.

If you already have a bias for action, then you can start working on harnessing your bias for action. You can shift gears from _building something_ to _building the right things_. You can start to think about opportunity cost.

On the other hand, if have trouble even starting things, then you can focus on beating resistance and developing your bias for action.

### Using Your Existing Skills

It may be hard to believe, but you have unique combination of skills and perspective that no one else has. There's a good chance that you already have knowledge that could be leveraged. There's a good chance that you already have the skills to create something useful. By actively solving a problem, you will always learn something new.

### Learning New Skills

We often feel that our skills are lacking. We could achieve more if only we had more skills. It is up to you to take action to gain new skills. The online world is chalk full of free learning resources. Bookstores and libraries are full of amazing, life changing books.

But the key to learning skills is doing something with those skills. A person with a bias for action doesn't just read a book, she creates something with the skills acquired. She solves a problem with those skills, creating experience which eventually turns into wisdom. She takes action.

### Buying Tools

Don't just buy tools, use them. If you must have a tool to achieve your goal, then borrow it or buy it, but make sure it doesn't just collect dust. Make sure you get a return on your investment.

Beware, the lack of tools can be a hidden form of resistance. Is there a creative or resourceful way you can move forward without the tool you think you need?

### Creating Value for Yourself

If you are just learning how to beat resistance, then start small. Change your mindset from one of immobility to one of motion. This will help you gain momentum. At this point, anything you create or do you can keep to yourself. Don't worry too much about outcomes.

Here are five things you can do today:

1. You can de-clutter around your house.
2. You can take an online course.
3. You can send someone a thank you note or a gift.
4. You can increase your 401k contribution by 1%. Because your 401k is pre-tax, it won't hurt as bad as you think.
5. You can cancel a subscription that you are paying for but never use.

### Creating Value for Others

At this point, things become scarier. When creating in public, resistance can be like pushing a boulder up a hill. What if my idea flops?

Now you have to make something _and_ share it with the public. Or better yet, share your idea with people first and then make something. This way you can get earlier feedback.

### The Failed Project

If you have built something that no one uses or likes, don't be discouraged. You learned valuable lessons along the way. Assuming you showed your creation to people, you discovered what people don't need. You solved technical problems and acquired more technical skills.

Or you never showed your output to anyone, but either way it felt good to make something.

    Rather produce things than sit in planning meetings
    Belives that building things and getting feedback leads to a virtuous cycle of building better things
    Typically follow a makers schedule
    Likes to make decisions based on data instead of gut feeling
    Believes that by building a demo-able prototype, that other stakeholders can understand the vision better and provide better feedback
